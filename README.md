# E-Commerce Website (Run4It)
This project is an e-commerce website centered around athletic apparel. It contains three pages routed together through react. The home page has slider images. The product page contains products, pulled from a MySQL database, that allows a user to filter by product type and price. The contact page has a form that dynamically adds the comment to the comment slider so users can see their comments. React and MySQL is linked together through Express.

## Getting Started

1. Use `npm install` to install all needed dependencies as listed by the package.json.

2. Use any preferred application to run the queries from the `.sql` files.

3. Create a `.env` in both the root directory and the test directory. The `.env` in the test directory should contain a different port for the tests.
